## ATRIC ##

Automated Accumulation Threshold selection and RIparian Corridor delineation (ATRIC) is a combination of two open-source algorithms that allows for automated accumulation threshold selection for stream network extraction, and watershed and riparian corridor delineation for given points on streams from digital elevation models. The algorithms were primarily developed by co-interfacing R and GRASS GIS.
